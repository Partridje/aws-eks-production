# Trivy Ignore File for vpc Module
# This module creates public subnets that are REQUIRED for certain AWS services.

# AVD-AWS-0164: Public subnets with map_public_ip_on_launch = true
# Justification: Public subnets are required for:
# - NAT Gateways (must be in public subnets)
# - Application Load Balancers (internet-facing)
# - Other AWS services that require public IP assignment
# This is intentional and required for the architecture.
